Playlist building python/tkinter script for the Audi and Lamborghini RNS-E head unit.

The RNS-E head unit will only play songs in alphabetical order. If a playlist is made, the order will not be set 
unless it is numbered. This script allows you to select a directory (most likely on an SD card) and order the songs
to your liking. The songs will then be numbered (and re-named with these numbers), so they will play in order you 
specify.
